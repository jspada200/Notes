# Observability for Serverless

LESS Visibility - We have less observability then we did in the past

Bare Metal

- See everything

VM

- If you were not the owner, had less
- Had a smaller but visible picture

Container

- Lost even more
- Encapsulated part of the systems

Serverless

- There is a server but we do not see it
- We have less knowledge

Why do we loss visibility

- Less accessability
- Less interaction
- More tools
- Lost logs
- Decoupling

We need a new more complex but more responsive approach
Structured Logs

practice of impl a consistent predetermined messg format for app logs to allow to be treated as data sets rather then text

Struct msg != Struct log

Observability has 3 elems

logs

- Need consistent logs of behavior, not just errors
- How does the system act "Normally"

traces

- Context for the behavior
- "What did this person do then."

metrics

- How does the system act "Normally"
- Can collect metrics from logs, but this is a long process
